"""Job state access, backed by the ``job`` table.

The single seam the app goes through for inference-job state, replacing the old
in-memory ``inference_jobs`` dict + job.json mirror. Each function owns its DB
session via ``session_scope`` so it works from both a Flask request thread and
(later) the standalone worker, neither needing an app context.

Leasing/claim logic is inert until the worker lands; keeping it here now makes
that step additive.
